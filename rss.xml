            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1> John 7:37-39</h1><p>On the last day of the feast, the great day, Jesus stood up and cried out, “If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink. Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, ‘Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.’” Now this he said about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were to receive, for as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/971d8a14ba9b5ed7ee104b685b7c062a9ee9580b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Philippians 4:4-9]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Philippians 4:4-9</h1><p>Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice. Let your reasonableness be known to everyone. The Lord is at hand; do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me—practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4be841dac9f676ffdaf7d86cddbebad3/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=2584&cropwidth=4975&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F656af5ed-41ff-4fcd-84dd-2a7cec9d4bcf.jpg&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>

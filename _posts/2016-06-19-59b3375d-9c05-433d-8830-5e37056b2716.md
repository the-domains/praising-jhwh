# Jeremiah 17:14

Heal me, O Lord , and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved, for you are my praise. Behold, they say to me, "Where is the word of the Lord? Let it come!" I have not run away from being your shepherd, nor have I desired the day of sickness. You know what came out of my lips; it was before your face. Be not a terror to me; you are my refuge in the day of disaster.

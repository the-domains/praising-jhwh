  Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice. Let your reasonableness
  be known to everyone. The Lord is at hand; do not be anxious about anything,
  but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your
  requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all
  understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. Finally,
  brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever
  is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any
  excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.
  What you have learned and received and heard and seen in meâ€”practice these
  things, and the God of peace will be with you.

# Philippians 4:4-9

Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice. Let your reasonableness be known to everyone. The Lord is at hand; do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me---practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you.

  O God, you are my God; earnestly I seek you; my soul thirsts for you; my flesh
  faints for you, as in a dry and weary land where there is no water. So I have
  looked upon you in the sanctuary, beholding your power and glory. Because your
  steadfast love is better than life, my lips will praise you. So I will bless
  you as long as I live; in your name I will lift up my hands. My soul will be
  satisfied as with fat and rich food, and my mouth will praise you with joyful
  lips, when I remember you upon my bed, and meditate on you in the watches of
  the night; for you have been my help, and in the shadow of your wings I will
  sing for joy. My soul clings to you; your right hand upholds me.

# Psalm 63:1-8

O God, you are my God; earnestly I seek you; my soul thirsts for you; my flesh faints for you, as in a dry and weary land where there is no water. So I have looked upon you in the sanctuary, beholding your power and glory. Because your steadfast love is better than life, my lips will praise you. So I will bless you as long as I live; in your name I will lift up my hands. My soul will be satisfied as with fat and rich food, and my mouth will praise you with joyful lips, when I remember you upon my bed, and meditate on you in the watches of the night; for you have been my help, and in the shadow of your wings I will sing for joy. My soul clings to you; your right hand upholds me.
